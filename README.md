# Simple_AQM
A simple Arduino based Air Quality Meter using MQ series sensors and 2004 I2C LCD display
Displays current, minute average and hour average for each sensor
Started with 3 sensors powered by USB
Arduino uses around 64 mA and each sensor 100mA for heater
developed for use in my lab especially when using my 3D printer and solvents!
